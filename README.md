PrimMST
=======

You can find the foundation for this program here : http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/43mst/PrimMST.java

This program finds the Minimum Spanning Tree of an Undirected Weighted Graph (G).
It also computes the 2nd Minimum Spanning Tree of G, that is, it computes the MST(G) that does not use edge E (where E is one of the edges from the original MST(G))
